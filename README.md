Following along with Sentdexâ€™s tutorial

This follows along with the tutorial: [Scikit-learn Machine Learning with Python and SKlearn](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDd0flgGphKCej-9jp-QdzZ3).

> How to use Scikit-learn (sklearn) with the python programming language to do Machine Learning with Support Vector Machines. Covered specifically here, we learn how to use Linear SVC to see if we can determine, based on fundamental information, whether a stock is likely to outperform the market or not.

# Parts

## Part 1 - Intro to Machine Learning with Scikit Learn and Python
Intro to a practical example of Machine Learning with the Python programming language and the Scikit-learn, or sklearn, module. We're covering an example with investing, where we use machine learning to discern fundamental characteristics of companies that perform well over a long term period.

## Part 2 - Simple Support Vector Machine (SVM) example with character recognition
Show you simple machine learning can actually be, where the real hard part is actually getting data, labeling data, and organizing the data. To emphasize this, we're going to use a pre-existing data set that comes with of Scikit-Learn.

## Part 3 - Our Method and where we will be getting our Data
Cover how to acquire, label and organize data, as well as figure out which machine learning algorithm to use.
