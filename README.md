This follows along with the tutorial: [Scikit-learn Machine Learning with Python and SKlearn](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDd0flgGphKCej-9jp-QdzZ3).

> How to use Scikit-learn (sklearn) with the python programming language to do Machine Learning with Support Vector Machines. Covered specifically here, we learn how to use Linear SVC to see if we can determine, based on fundamental information, whether a stock is likely to outperform the market or not.

# Parts

## Part 1 - Python Machine learning with SKLearn Tutorial for Investing - Intro
Intro to a practical example of Machine Learning with the Python programming language and the Scikit-learn, or sklearn, module. We're covering an example with investing, where we use machine learning to discern fundamental characteristics of companies that perform well over a long term period.

## Part 2 - Scikit Learn Machine Learning SVM Tutorial with Python p. 2 - Example
Show you simple machine learning can actually be, where the real hard part is actually getting data, labeling data, and organizing the data. To emphasize this, we're going to use a pre-existing data set that comes with of Scikit-Learn.
